# turn-based-rpg

A turn-based roleplaying game designed with 2D pixel graphics. Players will interact with a game world that includes a main overworld map, instanced levels, and instanced battle sequences.

For Developers:
To clone the repo, go to "<> Code", click "Open with GitHub Desktop", and choose your GameMakerStudio2 folder for Local path. Launch GameMaker, click "Open", navigate to the "turn-based-rpg-main" folder, open it, open the folder inside it, and select "Turn-Based-RPG.yyp". From here you can edit existing code, write new code, etc. To run the code, press F5, or click the play button (located directly below tools, and to the right of debug).

## External Requirements

In order to work on this code and run it without building an executable, you will need to download GameMaker. GameMaker is available for free at https://gamemaker.io/en/download for both Windows and Mac. This will download an executable installer which can run to install GameMaker on your system.

## Setup

As mentioned earlier, you will have to open GameMaker, click "Open", navigate to the "turn-based-rpg-main" folder, open it, open the folder inside it, and select "Turn-Based-RPG.ypp". As long as you are storing everything for this code in the same place, you should only have to do this once. After the first time, the project should be shown in the "Recent Projects" list on GameMaker's Start Page.

## Running

Open project in GameMaker. To run the code, press F5, or click the play button (located directly below tools, and to the right of debug).

# Testing

## Testing Technology

Since unit testing is not a supported feature in GameMaker Studio, all unit tests are enabled by functions created by the team, which compare expected and received output and display the compiled results in an executable game window.

## Running Tests

To run Unit Test 1, enter the "Testing" folder and then navigate to the "Unit Tests" folder. From there, simply run "unit_text_1.exe" and the results will be displayed.
